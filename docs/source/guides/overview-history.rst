Overview
========

NLNZ Tools SIP Generation is a common set of classes related to the generation of SIPs for ingestion into the Rosetta
archiving system. The aim is to provide core functionality that is shared across other tools that are specific to
ingestion type.

What it is *NOT*
----------------

-   It is *NOT* specific to a particular ingestion


History
=======

The National Library of New Zealand has a legal mandate, and a social responsibility, to preserve New Zealand's social
and cultural history, be it in the form of books, newspapers and photographs, or of websites, blogs and videos.
Increasing amounts of New Zealand's documentary heritage is only available online. Users find this content valuable and
convenient, but its impermanence, lack of clear ownership, and dynamic nature pose significant challenges to any
institution that attempts to acquire and preserve it.

NLNZ Tools SIP Generation is a common set of functionality for use in ingesting custom ingestion types. The first such
problem is the so-called *fairfax* ingestion, which is a feed from Fairfax of their digital print publications. The
sister project, NLNZ Tools Sip Generation - Fairfax is concerned with the custom processing involved with processing
the Fairfax files. This project targets common functionality that can be re-used across other custom ingestion projects.

Project objectives
------------------

-   Meets the needs of the National Library of New Zealand
-   Possibly provide helpful functionality or example processing to other users and institutions.

The tool is open-source software and is freely available for the benefit of the international archiving community.
